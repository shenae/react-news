# React and the News API

#### Introduction

This assignment is meant to reinforce what we have already learned and for you get into a good workflow as we approach Project 2. We want you to flex your creative muscles by building out a simple application.

## Getting Started:
- Fork and Clone this repo then `cd` into the repo.
- Run `npm init react-app news-app`.
- `cd` into the `news-app` folder.
- Install axios (`npm i axios`) or use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- Run `npm start`.

> **Housecleaning:** Remove or delete the pre-loaded `create-react-app` stuff that comes with it (`logo.svg, app.test.js, serviceWorker`, the code in `App.css`). _This step is mandatory_.

- Go to the [News API](https://newsapi.org/), create an account and sign up for an API key, it should be autogenerated.
- For this assignment, we want you to use the [Everything](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything) endpoint. Take a look through the docs to read through the data response object and request parameters(what is required?). Then, plan out what data you want to use in your app: Title and Description, seem like a good start.
- **Make sure you are able to see your data before you do this step!** Create a `.env` file in the `news-app` directory. `REACT_APP_API_KEY` would be a good variable name to assign to your API key!  
- **Restart your server**
- Put the `.env` file and your `node_modules` (this might already be there) in a `.gitignore` file.
- Once you can see your data, create **4 components** to use for your app.
    - What else in the data can you use as a component? 
- Styling is **required** for this assignment. You may style your App in the `App.css`


## Deliverables
- A **styled**, News App that has at least 4 components and makes a GET request to the News API!
- A pull request by **11PM**.
- Comfort and Completion levels.

## Bonus
- Create an input field that allows you to query for different topics. Hmmm, I wonder how many articles there are about Alex Trebek?
- A button that filters out articles by news source.  (i.e. a button that returns all the news from The New York Times)
- Use [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) to format the `publishedAt` date. Hmmm, what format is it in right now?  
- Use a component library to style your app! [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) or [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) (These are just examples, there are many others).
